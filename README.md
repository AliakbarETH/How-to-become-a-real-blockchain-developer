# How-to-become-a-real-blockchain-developer
Hi, this is first repository of it's kind as I am putting my all knowledge, research and the stuff that works for you to become a blockchain developer.

I would make a course outline and share my daily insights with you regarding what I have learned today.

Caution:

Alot of people come to me daily and ask that I need to become a blockchain developer but I don't know what to do and how to do?

They are mainly interested by this disruptive technology and the scope which is totally fine but they must also understand the other side.

They need to know web 2.0.

Now what is web 2.0 and what they should know?

Web 2.0 includes all the technologies with which we interact with on daily basis.

Like websites, mobile applications and the technologies on which we make them.

Web, mobile and desktop application is a way to deliver a service/product but the actual product maybe something else.

For example, you make a taxi finding application on react. It will give you a service to find a driver but is not the technology.

Similarly, you interact with an ecommerce website and purchase the product. It gives you a product but is not actually the technology.

Like wise, you interact with google chrome browser on desktop computer, it gives you browsing facilities but is not the actual technology.

For me technology is something that helps you to make technical products like react, react native, JAVA, Kotlin, python and many more.




So, you need to have a strong grisp of web 2.0

Now, I ask them where your interest lies?

You love mobile applications, desktop or web applications? 

Which one specifically?


And the answer is either don't know or most of them say web application as it is the first thing taught in the colleges these days.

Ok, let's come to the point.

So, you need to grasp web 2.0 technologies and understand how they work.

For example, I love to develop mobile applications in kotlin. 

Hence, I will learn kotlin, android studio(IDE) and Desigining( it's non technical, it's the way you think which again is technical but since we are talking about technology in a different context, we must say it's non technical. HCI guys please forgive me for this) 

Now the scinerio is, since I have learned web2.0 I can shift to web 3.0 very easily.

Conclusion:

You need to grasp a strong foundation of web 2.0 to jump into web 3.0

Now here comes the most interesting part.

Our all time favourite web3.0

To become a web3.0 developer you need to understand what is blockchain.

I would encourage you to first get the theortical concept of blockchain.

For this, I will give you my insights but I will give you links to some beautiful resources in last which I have used for myself.

After gaining theoritical concpets, it's time to get your hands dirty.

Yeah, you heard it right.

The programming stuff.

Now you need to learn a language to write smart contracts.

Since, ethereum is the first platform to give you a way to write smart contracts we will move to it and subsequently we will find the issues and will move to next stack but for now, we need to learn how to write smart contracts on ethereum blockchain using solidity programming language.

And don't worry, I will walk you with everything that will not have any version related issue and will give you the path straight to the point.

See you in the next tutorial.
